== Installation ==

1. You can download and install the Rich Reviews plugin through the built-in Wordpress plugin installer. Alternately, download the zip file and upload the '/rich-reviews/' folder to your '../wp-content/plugins/' folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. View the instructions page in your the Wordpress backend to see detailed explanations and examples of how and where to use the shortcodes which enable reviews to be shown, submitted, or averaged.
4. Periodically check the Rich Reviews menu in the Wordpress control panel to see if there are any pending reviews which need to be approved (or deleted).

== Screenshots ==

1. Show any number of reviews for your whole site, for a specific page or post, or for any custom category. Display these reviews in any post, page, sidebar, or widget!
2. A simple shortcode allows you to post an aggregate review score on any page, which means that Google will display a star-rating whenever your page comes up in a search.
3. A simple and clean review submission form can be placed anywhere on your site, and will not bog down your site.
4. Admin menus allow you to approve the submitted reviews, so YOU control what reviews are real, and which reviews are unwarranted (or even spam). You can also view every review you have already approved, and choose to push it back to a "pending" status, or even delete it.
5. Detailed explanations and examples ensure that you will never be confused as to how to use the plugin!

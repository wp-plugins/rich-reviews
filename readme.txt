== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.6.0 =
We updated the "rich snippets" of this plugin to use microdata instead of microformat - microdata is the new hotness and works much better with search engines. This is a big change for us, as the way we rendered meta data had remained the same for the last couple years, and slowly started to lose its applicability. We hope that this change will give greater compatibility between the metadata/rich snippet markup and search result summaries.

= 1.3 =
This adds the MUCH requested feature of having per-page/per-product reviews, as well as adding optional categories for further customization! The instructions page has also been overhauled to provide useful, relevant explanations and examples for each of the shortcodes.

= 1.2 =
This version is essential, as it fixes a bug where the MySQL database was not created unless the plugin had been installed at version 1.0

= 1.1 =
This version pretties up the reviews and the form, and fixes the CSS to allow vertical stacking of reviews in, say, a sidebar. Also implements an "approved reviews" menu to view and change the status of previously-approved reviews.

= 1.0 =
Initial release
